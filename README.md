# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Banking-Data
Performed exploratory data analysis on a real-world banking dataset to uncover patterns in client subscription behavior. Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize trends and extract actionable insights.

## Project Files:
- `EDA_script.py` – Python script with the full EDA workflow
- `bank_data.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `bank_insights.pptx` – Presentation summarizing key findings
- `problem_statement.txt` – Business problem and objective

## Tools & Libraries Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Objective

To analyze customer behavior and identify key features that influence whether a client subscribes to a banking service, helping stakeholders design more effective outreach campaigns.

## Key Insights

This EDA revealed key behavioral and demographic trends affecting client subscription to term deposits. Variables like call duration, previous campaign success, job type, education, and age showed meaningful influence. These insights can guide more targeted and effective client outreach strategies.

## How to Run

1. Ensure `bank_data.csv` is in the same directory.
2. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python EDA_script.py
